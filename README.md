# Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models
This project aims to build a deep learning model that detects hallucinations in outputs generated by large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Hallucinations in this context refer to the generation of plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or nonsensical information.

## Introduction

Large language models, while powerful, can sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical, known as hallucinations. This project addresses the problem by building a binary classifier that determines whether a given output from an LLM is correct or hallucinated.
