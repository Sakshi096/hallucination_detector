# Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models
This project aims to build a deep learning model that detects hallucinations in outputs generated by large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Hallucinations in this context refer to the generation of plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or nonsensical information.

## Project Overview
With the increasing use of LLMs in various applications, there is a critical need to ensure the accuracy of the information they generate. Hallucinations pose a significant challenge, as they can lead to misinformation and reduce trust in AI systems. This project addresses this issue by developing a deep learning model that can detect hallucinations in generated text.

## Problem Definition

Hallucinations in LLMs occur when the model generates content that is not grounded in the provided context or external knowledge. These hallucinations can range from minor factual inaccuracies to completely fabricated information. The challenge is to distinguish between creative, acceptable outputs and those that are factually incorrect.

The key objectives of this project are:
1. **Detection**: Identify instances of hallucinations in generated text.
2. **Classification**: Categorize hallucinations by their severity (e.g., minor inaccuracies vs. major fabrications).
3. **Mitigation**: Suggest corrections or flag outputs for review.

## Model Architecture

The hallucination detection system consists of two main components:

1. **Feature Extraction**: This component uses a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant features from the generated text. These features include:
   - **Semantic Coherence**: Measures how well the generated text aligns with the input prompt or context.
   - **Fact Verification**: Uses external knowledge bases or fact-checking models to verify the factual correctness of statements.
   - **Consistency Checks**: Compares the generated output with known facts or previously generated text for consistency.

2. **Classification Model**: A deep learning model, typically a transformer-based architecture like BERT, is used to classify the text as either hallucinated or non-hallucinated based on the extracted features. The model is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset containing examples of both hallucinated and accurate outputs.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is curated to include:

- **Prompt-Response Pairs**: Text prompts paired with generated responses from LLMs.
- **Annotations**: Labels indicating whether a response contains hallucinations, and if so, the type and severity of the hallucination.
- **External Knowledge Sources**: Databases and fact-checking resources used to validate the factual correctness of responses.

The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Training Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The text data is preprocessed, including tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction.
2. **Model Training**: The classification model is trained on the preprocessed data. The training process involves:
   - Fine-tuning the model on labeled examples.
   - Monitoring validation performance to prevent overfitting.
   - Using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robust model performance.

3. **Loss Function**: The model is trained using a loss function that balances accuracy with the ability to correctly identify hallucinations. Common choices include Binary Cross-Entropy for binary classification tasks or Categorical Cross-Entropy for multi-class classification.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using several key metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions.
- **Precision and Recall**: Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions (hallucination detection), while recall measures the model's ability to identify all hallucinations.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix that shows the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping to understand the model's performance in more detail.
- **AUC-ROC Curve**: The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, which provides insight into the model's performance across different thresholds.

## Inference and Detection

To detect hallucinations in new text generated by an LLM:

1. **Input Text**: The generated text from the LLM is passed through the feature extraction pipeline.
2. **Prediction**: The preprocessed features are fed into the trained classification model, which outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of hallucination.
3. **Decision Threshold**: Based on the probability score, a decision is made whether to flag the text as hallucinated. This threshold can be adjusted based on the desired sensitivity of the detection system.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to this project could include:

- **Multi-Modal Hallucination Detection**: Expanding the model to detect hallucinations in multi-modal outputs, such as text generated in response to images or audio prompts.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Optimizing the system for real-time hallucination detection in live applications.
- **Explainability**: Developing methods to provide explanations for why a piece of text was flagged as hallucinated, improving user trust and model transparency.
