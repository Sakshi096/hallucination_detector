Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models
This project aims to build a deep learning model that detects hallucinations in outputs generated by large language models (LLMs) like GPT. Hallucinations in this context refer to the generation of plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or nonsensical information.

Introduction
Large language models, while powerful, can sometimes generate text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical, known as hallucinations. This project addresses the problem by building a binary classifier that determines whether a given output from an LLM is correct or hallucinated.

pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Collection
The dataset used in this project consists of examples of LLM-generated outputs, labeled as either correct or hallucinated. This data is loaded and processed in the data.py file.

Example Data Format
python
Copy code
data = [
    {"text": "The capital of France is Paris.", "label": "correct"},
    {"text": "The capital of Germany is Berlin.", "label": "correct"},
    {"text": "The capital of the United States is New York.", "label": "hallucinated"},
    {"text": "Albert Einstein was born in Germany.", "label": "correct"},
    {"text": "Albert Einstein invented the telephone.", "label": "hallucinated"},
]
Model Architecture
The model is based on the BertForSequenceClassification architecture from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It has been fine-tuned to classify whether a piece of text contains hallucinations.

The model is defined in model.py as follows:

python
Copy code
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

class HallucinationDetector(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, n_classes=2):
        super(HallucinationDetector, self).__init__()
        self.bert = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=n_classes)
    
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.bert(
            input_ids=input_ids,
            attention_mask=attention_mask
        )
        return outputs.logits
Training the Model
To train the model, run the train.py script. This script loads the dataset, prepares it using the tokenizer, and trains the model.

Running the Training Script
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluating the Model
After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the evaluate.py script. This script calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Running the Evaluation Script
bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
Example Evaluation Output
plaintext
Copy code
Accuracy: 0.90
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.88
F1-Score: 0.86
Inference
The inference.py script allows you to detect hallucinations in new text generated by an LLM. You can use the detect_hallucination function provided in the script.
